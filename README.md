Trello Activity Board
=============

Fulfilling a basic need of mine, this app shows you recent activity on all your [trello](http://trello.com) boards. It will automatically refresh once a minute and highlight new actions. You can get rid of highlights by refreshing manually. 

I invested a little time in design and functionality, but it it still a very early alpha kind of application.

Newest features:

- Cards can be clicked to get load trello.
- Flickering during reload is gone.

Feedback & change requests are welcome, but it's best if you just submit a pull request for things you'd like to see.
