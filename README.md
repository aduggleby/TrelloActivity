Trello Activity Board
=============

Needed a very simple way to see if there were changes on multiple boards. This app uses the Trello API to check for changes once a minute and displays them in red if the are new since the last manual refresh (or the first page load). 

This is very very very barebones (there isn't even a link to the card yet) but it fulfills my purpose for now.

Any changes welcome, feedback also, but I can't promise I get to anything.
