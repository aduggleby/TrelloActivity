Trello Activity Board
=============

I needed a very simple way to see if there were changes on multiple [trello](http://trello.com) boards. This is my early alpha non-tested-much-at-all version of an app that does that.

Uses the Trello API to check for changes once a minute. Changes are highlighted in red (if they have occured since the last manual interaction, i.e. refresh button pressed or page load). 

This is *very very very* barebones (there isn't even a link to the card yet) but it did the job for me right now. Any changes welcome, feedback also, but I can't promise I get to anything. (Pull requests make me happy.)
